# Trivy Webhook AWS Security Hub

This application processes vulnerability reports from **Trivy**, a vulnerability scanning tool for containers, and imports the findings into **AWS Security Hub**. It acts as a webhook receiver that listens for vulnerability reports sent by Trivy and processes them before forwarding the results to AWS Security Hub.

## Features

- Receives vulnerability reports via an HTTP POST request.
- Supports importing CVE findings into **AWS Security Hub**.
- Designed for integration with **container image scanning** and **Kubernetes environments**.
- Selectively process different types of reports using **configurable environment variables**.
- Logs and reports errors for easier troubleshooting.

## How It Works

1. **Vulnerability Report**: The application listens for incoming vulnerability reports in JSON format from Trivy via a `/trivy-webhook` endpoint.
2. **Validation**: The incoming report is validated based on its type (e.g., `VulnerabilityReport`, `ConfigAuditReport`).
3. **AWS Security Hub Integration**: Vulnerabilities and other security findings are imported into AWS Security Hub.
4. **Health Check**: The `/healthz` endpoint provides a simple health check for the application.

## Deletion handling

The webhook accepts both raw report bodies and the `{"verb":"update|delete","operatorObject":{...}}` envelope that trivy-operator sends when `OPERATOR_SEND_DELETED_REPORTS=true`. Setting that flag on the Trivy Operator makes deleted reports transition the corresponding Security Hub findings to `RecordState=ARCHIVED` (re-imported with the same finding Id). Without the flag, deletions are not propagated and findings stay `ACTIVE` indefinitely.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: This application uses AWS Security Hub to store and manage security findings, so you must have an active AWS account and the necessary permissions.
- **Trivy**: You must set up Trivy to scan container images and send reports to the webhook endpoint.
- **Go**: The application is written in Go, so you'll need Go installed to build and run it.
- **Security Hub Product Subscription**: You must accept findings from `Aqua Security: Aqua Security` in AWS Security Hub. This allows the application to import findings into Security Hub.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csepulveda/trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub.git
cd trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub
```

### 2. Build the application

Make sure Go is installed and set up correctly:

```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub
```

### 3. Run the application

Start the application locally:

```bash
./trivy-webhook-aws-security-hub
```

The server will start and listen on port `8080`.

### 4. Set up Trivy to send reports

Configure Trivy to send vulnerability reports to the `/trivy-webhook` endpoint of the running application.

Example:

```bash
trivy image --format json --output result.json <image>
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @result.json http://localhost:8080/trivy-webhook
```
